#Scenario: Successfully processing a single language GB Cerillion Bill XML file through to StreamServe.
#Given the invoice data service is deployed
#And a Cerillion billing XML file "BDD01-GB-120_130620_00001.xml" is created with Country Code "GB" and Language "en-gb"
#And a number shielding list contains:
#|Country |Number       |
#|GB      |447408901403 |
#When an localiseInvoiceData message is received containing:
#|xmlFilePath       |xmlFileName                  |billCycleCd |billDate            |billCount |countryCode |
#|target/invoice/in |BDD01-GB-120_130620_00001.xml|120         |1999-12-31T23:59:00 |19        |GB          |
#Then the bill file "BDD01-GB-120_130620_00001.xml" will be consumed
#And a single bill xml will be output to StreamServe directory containing:
#|xmlFilePath        |xmlFileName                   |billCycleCd |billDate           |billCount |countryCode |billLanguage|
#|target/invoice/out |BDD01-GB-120_130620_00001.xml |120         |1999-12-31T23:59:00|1         |GB          |en-gb       |
